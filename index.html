    <h3><i>Ajit Pai: Chairman of the FCC</i></h3>
    <section>
      <h1 id="introduction">What is net neutrality?</h1>
      <p>A viral video titled PSA from Chairman of the FCC Ajit Pai came out in 2017 featuring Ajit Pai listing 7 things you can still do without the internet receiving around 300,000 dislikes. Ajit Pai is the FCC official who repealed net neutrality, the laws that enforce equality on how websites are treated by internet service providers. The origins of net neutrality go back to the Obama administration and have been debated over since the 1990s.  Net neutrality allows for free browsing preventing censorship and unreasonable pricing by internet service providers (ISPs). Net neutrality shouldn’t have been repealed because ISPs now have unnecessary power to ban free speech or overprice, have throttled firefighters, and have unfairly favored larger ISPs.</p>

      <h1 id="point1">ISP Power</h1>
      <p>Many ISPs think that the removal of net neutrality not been shown to ban free speech or over throttle, but this does not prevent it from happening.  A counter argument is that ISPs promised to not block or throttle. According to procon.org, “A 2017 statement from the Internet & Television Association, signed by 21 large ISPs, stated they remain ‘committed to an open internet’ and ‘will not block, throttle or otherwise impair your online activity,’ once net neutrality regulations are removed”(ProCon.org, 2018). It is also said that there aren’t many problems with ISPs doing anything harmful in general. Procon.org says “As economist Gerald R. Faulhaber argues: ‘we have had a decade of experience with broadband ISPs with little evidence of wrongdoing’”(ProCon.org, 2018). Both of these examples do not stop ISPs from breaking promises or doing it because of no legal boundaries.  Another procon.org quote shows that “Jessica Rosenworcel stated that the removal of net neutrality rules will give ISPs ‘extraordinary new power’ and allow them ‘to censor online content’”(ProCon.org, 2018). Not only is it possible, but it has already happened.</p>

      <h2 id="point2">Throttling</h2>
      <p>Another argument against net neutrality is that nothing bad has happened yet that caused net neutrality to happen, but firefighters were throttled in the middle of an emergency. Anti-net neutrality supportes have said that without net neutrality, nothing bad has happened. An article from the Washington Examiner states “‘No big changes,” reads a Wired headline atop an article explaining that ‘broadband providers didn't make any drastic new moves to block or cripple the delivery of content after the FCC's order revoking its Obama-era net neutrality protections took effect’” (Wegmann, 2018). Another argument is that the internet was fine without regulation. Procon.org says “Most large internet companies including Google (1998), Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005), and Twitter (2006) were started and grew to success without net neutrality regulations”(ProCon.org, 2018). This is not true because fire fighters were throttled during a fire emergency. According to ABC news, “In the middle of battling the Mendocino Complex Fire, Verizon was throttling, or deliberately slowing, internet speeds on their phones, Santa Clara fire officials wrote in email exchanges reviewed by ABC News” (Youn, 2019). </p>

      <h2 id="point3">Large ISPs</h2>
      <p>One argument is that big ISPs suffer from net neutrality, however, it does not affect them much and supports smaller ISPs. Net neutrality made a big ISP, Century Link, pay up to $134,000 and cost 5,000 hours of paperwork. Procon.org says “the policy of the United States "to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market... for the Internet and other interactive computer services unfettered by Federal or State regulation.”(ProCon.org, 2018) These problems against big ISPs do not matter much, and net neutrality improves competition.  According to Internet Association President & CEO Michael Beckerman, ‘without net neutrality protections, startups would face discrimination from ISP owned or preferred content that’s granted a speed advantage through paid prioritization,’ thus hurting competition and consumer choice. ” This point is furthur proven through the quote from eff.org: “Major ISPs Have Had Their Profits Enhanced by Billions in Tax Cuts and Have Delivered Nothing in Return” (Falcon, 2018).</p>

      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Banning free speech, throttling in an emergency, and unfairly balancing ISPs are all effects of no net neutrality. Large ISPs have much more power than necessary and Net Neutrality should be put back in place to solve this problem. The repeal of net neutrality gives the potential to cause harm and already has in the middle of an emergency. The world could change drastically without net neutrality causing no freedom of speech, and overpriced internet.</p>
